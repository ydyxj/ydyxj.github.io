- Here is **Dongyang Yan (Susie, 闫冬阳)**. 
Thank you for visiting my website. 
- If you are interested in any aspect of my work, I would be delighted to engage in a discussion and explore potential collaboration opportunities, please email me at - *ydyxj[at]hotmail[dot]com*

## Research Experience

**Apr 2025 - Current:** The University of Tokyo ([Postdoc](https://www.brain.ipc.i.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/)) 

## Academic Background

**Apr 2020 - Mar 2025:**  Hokkaido University (Phd)

**Sep 2014 - Jan 2016:** University of York (MA)
 
**Sep 2010 - Jul 2014:** Zhengzhou University (BA)



## Research Interests

- Neurolinguistics
- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Neurobiology
- Neuronal Oscillation
- Second language acquisition
- Multisensory perception/integration
- M/EEG, fMRI


My research focused on investigating the brain activation associated with reading, particularly the impact of language proficiency on brain network changes. Recently, I am interested in using **MEG** or **multi-modal imaging techniques** and **phase amplitude coupling methods** to understand the neurobiological substrate underlying **multisensory perception, speech, and language language functions**.
