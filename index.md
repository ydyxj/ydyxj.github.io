- **Sep 2010 - Jul 2014:** Zhengzhou University (BA)



## Research Interests

- Neurolinguistics
- Cognitive Neuroscience
- Neurobiology
- Second language acquisition
- Reading
- Multisensory integration
- M/EEG, fMRI

My research focused on investigating the brain activation associated with reading, particularly the impact of language proficiency on brain network changes. Recently, I am interested in using **multi-modal imaging techniques** to understand the neurobiological substrate underlying language functions, with a particular focus on **second language processing**.
